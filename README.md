# DESCRIPTION
I have successfully set up monitoring for a cloud-based application using AWS CloudWatch as part of my internship at CodTech. I created and configured a custom alarm named "Alarm_new" to monitor ConcurrentExecutions for the AWS Lambda service. This alarm actively tracks execution metrics and is currently in a healthy state, marked as "OK", with no active or insufficient data alarms. The dashboard visually displays recent metric activity, showing that the function executions remained within safe thresholds.

I also configured the CloudWatch overview to display real-time alerts and categorized them by service, providing centralized visibility. The left-side panel allows quick access to alarms, logs, and metrics, making the monitoring setup efficient and user-friendly. This fulfills the internship deliverable to set up configured alerts and a dashboard showcasing metrics.

The CloudWatch interface will now continuously help detect performance issues or abnormal activity in my cloud application.
